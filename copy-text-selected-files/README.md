This Visual Studio Code extension enables users to directly copy the contents of selected files to the clipboard.
This command can save the selected files to the clipboard as markdown consisting of a header and codeblock.
This is useful for easy pasting into GPT and querying them.

## Features

- **Copy Single File**: Right-click a file in the Explorer panel and choose "Copy Content of Selected Files" to copy its contents to the clipboard.
- **Copy Multiple Files**: Select multiple files, right-click on one, and select "Copy Content of Selected Files" to copy their contents. Each content is preceded by its file name and path.
- **Copy Directory Contents**: Right-click on a directory and choose "Copy Content of Selected Files" to copy the contents of all files within, including subdirectories.

## Usage

In Visual Studio Code, go to the Explorer view, select one or more files or a directory, right-click, and select "Copy Content of Selected Files".

## Example

Consider you have the following files:

`index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

`src\global.scss`

```scss
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}
```

Selecting both files and using the "Copy Content of Selected Files" command, the clipboard will contain:

````
### index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
<h1>hello world</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### src\global.scss

```scss
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}
```
````

## Keyboard Shortcuts

This extension supports the following keyboard shortcuts for faster operation:
